## Welcome to Veracity for Developers


Veracity is designed to help companies unlock, qualify, combine and prepare data for analytics and benchmarking. We want to help our customers leverage the ever-increasing amount of data they own. 
On the platform’s marketplace, asset owners can access industrial applications and data analytics services that can help them make better use of their data to optimize their performance. These apps will be provided not only by DNV, but by many other qualified providers of data, data analytics and digital solutions too. Veracity for Developers is designed to support the IT pros, developers and analysts on both the data provider side and the data consumer side.

### Where do I start?
With all the new opportunities Veracity enables for both asset owners and service providers, it can be a daunting task to figure out which services you need to support in your solution architecture. Here are some quick tips and links.

- **How do I create a service on Veracity**: We are happy to start working with 3rd party providers to onboard new services. The end-to-end process is still under construction, but you can start reading up on the [onboarding a service](https://developer.veracity.com/doc/onboarding-a-service) documentation and reach out to the Veracity team for further info.
- **Can anybody sell data or a service in the marketplace?** Yes! Veracity is an open B2B platform, and we allow complementary services and competing services on to the platform. 
- **How do we get paid when selling a product on Veracity?** Through Veracity. We provide an E-Commerce solution, in cooperation with Oracle, on Veracity.
- **Where can I find code samples to get started?** All code samples are open source, and on our [GitHub](https://www.github.com/Veracity) account. Fork our repositories and follow the tutorials in the documentation [here](https://developer.veracity.com/docs) on Veracity for developers.  
- **How can I test out the [data fabric](#data-fabric-currently-in-public-preview-phase)?** If you would like to get access, you can request it from the [product page](https://store.veracity.com/8ad08065-7fa8-475f-9055-83067132c022). We continue to work with leading customers and providers to verify the design and functionality of these elements of the platform, and explore how value can be best created for asset owners and analytic providers. 
- **Is there a Veracity developer program?** The Veracity developer program will be announced in the near future.
- **I want to contribute to open source, is this possible?** Great, yes! We embrace open source, you are more than welcome to do a pull request on any of our public repositories - please read the contributor guidelines in the repositories on GitHub. We not only share open source, but we also contribute with developer's code. We have some projects already on GitHub. Feel free to join.



### Veracity high-level architecture
Veracity consists of multiple high-level components. The marketplace and my services, with accompanying APIs enable you to create, market and sell services or data, together with an E-commerce solution. Further to this, the Veracity data fabric enables you to share and combine data in a trusted environment. The Veracity data fabric is built in partnership with Microsoft Azure, and supplemented by key partners in the industry, enabling Big Data capability on a global scale.

#### Marketplace
The Marketplace within Veracity is an Oracle based E-Commerce solution which allows external customers to browse, enquire and purchase digital services and data that are offered by both DNV and external 3rd party providers. Veracity is an open neutral platform, and for that reason we allow services and data to be offered by both internal and external providers. There is no need for a direct affiliation with DNV, however there is an integration process which has mandatory requirements to ensure the quality of product and service provided. To get going with this process, please reach out to the Veracity team and we'll help you get started. Also, check out the [Onboarding a Service](https://developer.veracity.com/doc/onboarding-a-service) documentation for more technical detail.


#### My services
Consumers will find all the digital services they have access to on the Veracity platform in their service overview called My Services. They will be able to use these digital services without additional log in, as it is a prerequisite for service providers to integrate their digital services with the DNV identity provider. Consumers will buy the services on the Marketplace and when the service is purchased it will appear in My Services. Automatic provisioning of the service to the consumer is currently available for free services, typically trial products, that have an integration with the service subscription API.



#### Data fabric
The data sharing and data analytics part of Veracity is now in general availability, where users can get request access. We still continue to work together with customers and providers to understand future requirements for the product and take these into the roadmap.

More functionality, services, and providers will be continuously added. You may investigate the code samples and documentation related to the data fabric, and feel free to reach out to the Veracity team for any additional questions.
