## Overview

Veracity is an open, neutral, platform that allows services to be offered by both internal and external providers. There is no need for a direct affiliation with DNV, however there is an integration process which has mandatory requirements to ensure the quality of product and service provided.

To get started you need to know about:
1. [How to integrate with our identity provider](https://developer.veracity.com/doc/identity)
2. [How the Veracity data fabric works](#veracity-data-fabric)
3. [How My services works and how you integrate](#my-services-and-the-service-api)
3. [How to best present your product on the Marketplace](#how-to-best-present-your-product-in-the-marketplace)

In addition to exploring this documentation, you will need to contact the Veracity team to start the onboarding process. In general terms, the process involve the following steps:

## Veracity data fabric
Veracity Data Fabric provides data management functionality for cloud and on-premise for an improved data visibility, insights, access control and security.

We support two roles: Data Manager, create and manage data lake; Data Consumer, read only access to data lake.

Data managers can takes advantage of the Veracity ecosystem whereby they can combine their datasets with others available from Veracity Marketplace to enrich their own data to create new insights and solutions.

Documentation on the [data fabric API](https://developer.veracity.com/doc/data-fabric-api), [data fabric in general](https://developer.veracity.com/docs), and sample code on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/veracity) to get a feeling for what opportunities the data fabric enables. 

## My services and the service API
Consumers will find all the digital services they have access to on the Veracity platform in their service overview called My Services. They will be able to use the digital services without additional log in as it is a prerequisite for service providers to integrate their digital services with the DNV identity provider. Consumers will buy services on the Marketplace, and once purchased the service will appear in My Services. Automatic provisioning of the service to the consumer is currently available for free services, typically trial products, that have an integration with the service subscription API. 

To get the complete overview of the Service API and understand the full potential of the API, start reading up on the documentation [Service API](https://developer.veracity.com/doc/service-api).

## Marketplace
Marketplace allows purchases to be made by businesses and authorised individual users only. Purchases can be made via a registered Veracity account or by guests, if sufficient mandatory information is provided. Registering a Veracity account offers the convenience that credentials can be stored for future purchases. Both digital services and data can be sold through the Marketplace. 

Purchases are made via the Veracity E-commerce solution, which is an integrated part of the Marketplace.

### How to best present your product in the Marketplace
Your product's blurb on the marketplace is your primary sales pitch towards 100,000+ Veracity users. Veracity will take care of presenting your information, but you will need to provide the text, images, links and optional videos. Your product will be presented in the following way:
