# Veracity Data Workbench Migration: Important Information
Welcome to the Veracity Data Workbench migration page. 

Here you find all the relevant information and resources that you need to prepare for the transition from Veracity Data Fabric/My Data to Veracity Data Workbench.


## What's Happening?

We are phasing out Veracity Data Fabric/My Data and transitioning to Veracity Data Workbench, a more powerful and feature-rich platform designed to enhance your data management experience, in a secure environment.

## Important Dates:

* Migration Deadline: 31 December 2024
* Veracity Data Fabric/My Data Closure: 1 January 2025
* Data Access Post-Closure: Data will be stored for an additional 12 months, during which it can be requested directly from us by contacting support@veracity.com.

To avoid disruptions in your data management activities, we strongly recommend that you start planning your migration process now, with an aim of completing it by the end of Q3 2024.

## What do you need to do?
### Are you a user accessing shared data?
* Contact your service owner

### Are you a Data Manager?
As a Data Manager you need to download your data before the deadline provided above. When doing this you have two choices:

1. __Download and migrate your data into the "Data storage" section inside the Veracity Data Workbench application__
  This can be achieved in two main steps:
  1\. Download your data from Data Fabric / My data (please refer to our [Download Guide](https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/datafabric/tutorials/download-my-data)).
  2\. Subscribe to "[Data Workbench Storage](https://store.veracity.com/6-ea69-4b8c-9c72-df35f2a00)" and upload your data here.
  \
  Once your subscription is confirmed, you will receive an activation email. Please note that this might take up to a few days. When the activation is completed, you are ready to start using Veracity Data Workbench. Read the How-To Guide for a better introduction.
&nbsp;
2. __Download your data and manage them with your own solution (please refer to our [Download Guide](https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/datafabric/tutorials/download-my-data))__

&nbsp;
Whether you decide for option 1 or 2 above, you must communicate the change to the users of your data.   

__Inform users of your data__ - as a Data Manager, it is your responsibility to communicate these changes to the users of your data. Ensure they are aware of the intended timeline and have access to the necessary resources.

Still unsure about what to choose, or in need of extra assistance?

Please contact us at support@veracity.com.

We look forward to continue providing you with a superior data management experience, further enhanced by new Veracity Data Workbench. 
Thank you.
