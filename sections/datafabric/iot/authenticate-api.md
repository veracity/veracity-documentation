# Authenticate for Veracity IoT Api and Event api

- Events are ingested into Veracity using API and requested using API. 
- Sensor data supports several ingest methods, but query of sensor-data is done using API.
- The apis are accessible from [api-portal](https://api-portal.veracity.com/). 


## API overview
 - Data Fabric IoT Event Ingest API (Ingest events)
 - Data Fabric IoT Event request (Query API for events)
 - Data Fabric Time Series API  (Query API for timeseries data)

 
## How to authenticate
There are two ways of making requests to the Veracity Iot & Events API endpoints. You can request the API 
either as a user through API Portal/Postman or as application through Postman/Code. 
- When you request the endpoints as user, then your personal token and API Key are being used. 
- On the other hand, when you make requests as application then application token and API key are being used.



## API request as user (User credentials - B2C token)

1. Visit the Veracity API Portal: https://api-portal.veracity.com/

changes to the Request Body and click at Send on bottom of page. 
 

### Use Postman instead of API Portal

You can copy the value of Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key and Authorization from API Portal. 
Please paste those values in the header of any endpoint. In this case your personal API key and token
are being used from Postman.

## Api request as application (application credentials)
The rest api can be invoked directly from you application. An SDK is provided for .Net and for Python.


### Get token
For each api call you need to provide a token.

1. Receive token
