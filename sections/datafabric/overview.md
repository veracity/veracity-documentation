# Overview of the Veracity Data fabric
Veracity Data Fabric provides data management functionality for cloud and on-premise for an improved data visibility, insights, access control and security.
Data Fabric support two roles: Data Manager, create and manage data lake; Data Consumer, read only access to data lake.

Data managers can takes advantage of the Veracity ecosystem whereby they can combine their datasets with others available from Veracity Marketplace to enrich their own data to create new insights and solutions.

## Combine data with world class analytics tools

Data Fabric connects to IoT Hub, Event Hub, to an eco-system of service providers and a wide variety of Analytics technologies. It makes it possible for you to securely share your data for advanced analytics with tools like Arundo Fabric, Azure Databricks, Azure HDInsight, Azure Machine Learning Studio etc.

Data of any type that could be currently stored in files, database tables, data streams, objects, or sensor data can be collected into a Veracity storage container.

## Self-service and APIs at core

Data fabric is built with self-service at core, and the users are able to access the fabric to ingress and egress data using Veracity or Azure storage explorer as well as Veracity APIs.

## Security and data protection

Sharing of data is done using Shared Access Signature (SAS) keys which provide a way to granting and revoking access at any time. Activities related to stored data in the container can be tracked in the ledger and reviewed by the container owner. Keys can only be shared with other authorized platform users.
