# Datalake and Storage

Veracity is a cloud-based, enterprise-grade data lake solution, currently built on Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2). ADLS Gen2 is fully integrated with the Azure Blob Storage platform, offering a robust set of capabilities, including:

* Managed identity (Veracity Idp) for secure identity and access management
* Encryption at rest to ensure data protection
* High availability and disaster recovery for business continuity
* Automated lifecycle management to optimize storage costs
* Storage account firewalls for enhanced security and compliance (Verit VNet)

To efficiently process structured data during ingestion, Veracity utilizes a Spark and SQL engine. This enables scalable data transformation and validation, and ensures efficient storage as Delta Tables, which are optimized for fast and reliable querying.

This infrastructure provides a secure, scalable foundation for managing large volumes of data, supporting advanced analytics, AI services, and collaborative data sharing across industries.

## Structured datasets or file storage

Data can be stored in two main ways: structured or unstructured. Structured data follows a clear format, like rows and columns in a table, making it easy to organize and analyze. Unstructured data, on the other hand, stores files in its original form (like documents, images, or videos) and is only processed when itâ€™s needed.
