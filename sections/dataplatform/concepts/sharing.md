# Data sharing

Secure data sharing is a fundamental capability of the Veracity Data Platform, enabling controlled access to data assets while maintaining strict compliance with security standards.

Each workspace within Veracity serves as an isolated container in the data lake, functioning as a distinct security boundary. This ensures that data stored in one workspace remains inaccessible to others unless explicitly shared—preserving confidentiality and data integrity.

Veracity supports granular sharing options, allowing data to be shared either with individual users or with entire workspaces, and with configurable read or write permissions. This flexibility empowers teams to collaborate effectively while maintaining full control over data access.
