# Data catalogue and discovery

The Data Catalogue within the workspace provides a comprehensive overview of all available data assets. This includes structured and unstructured data, shared datasets, and user-defined schemas. It serves as a central point for discovering and managing data resources within the workspace, supporting efficient data utilization and collaboration.

View all datasets and files available in your workspace from the [Data Catalogue](https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/dataworkbench/datacatalogue).

You can access the same data using apis:

-[Dataset queries](datasetquery.md)
-[File queries](filequery.md)
-[Asset model queries](../mms/assetmodelquery.md)
-[Event queries](../event)
