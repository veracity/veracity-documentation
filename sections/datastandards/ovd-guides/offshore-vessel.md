Starting with 1 January 2025, the MRV Maritime Regulation will apply to offshore ships of and above 5 000 GT, as well as offshore ships and general cargo ships between 400 and 5 000 GT.

Although the reporting does not differ from what other ship types must report for DNV's Verification services, [this document](https://veracitycdnprod.blob.core.windows.net/developer/veracitystatic/ovd/Offshore%20vessels%20-%20Reporting%20Requirements.pdf) describes and exemplifies some special considerations for those ships.
