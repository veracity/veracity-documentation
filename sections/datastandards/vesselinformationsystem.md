# Vessel Information System (VIS) and Generic Product Model (GMOD)

VIS is an abbreviation for Vessel Information Systems, which has been used in DNV GLs production tools for classification of vessels since 2005. VIS contains a hierarchy of functions and libraries of equipment, where a name and code is defined for each item. The coding is based on the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) numbering system.

The VIS standard is a generic functional description of a vessel with a library of standard components with reference to functions they can perform. Using VIS, it is possible to generate a vessel-specific product model comprising a vessel-specific functional hierarchy in which vessel-specific components are instantiated and positioned. All vessels classed with DNV GL have a vessel-specific model, whether it is a new building or a class entry.

The model is used to structure various types of information such as document and certification requirements, approval comments, surveyor findings, conditions and non-conformities, coating condition assessment, data recordings throughout the vessel’s lifecycle

Since VIS has been refined and maintained for more than 15 years, it has become a mature information resource. As of today (2020) VIS contains definitions of more than 2500 functions and 750 components defined covering a wide range of components and systems used onboard a vessel. These generic libraries are referred to as GMOD – the generic product model. The instance or ship-specific product model is called PMOD.

As GMOD provides a rich language and functional structure of a vessel, it can be used for other purposes than classification. In ISO 19848, the VIS/GMOD is used as “codebooks” to provide unique identification strings for IoT sensors and data sources on ships. See DNVGL-VIS Naming rule defined in Annex C of ISO 19848.
