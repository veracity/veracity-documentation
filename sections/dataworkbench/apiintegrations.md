# API integrations

You can integrate APIs with Data Workbench. To do so, you need a service account.

## To add a new service account
To add a new account:
1. In your workspace, select the **API Integrations** tab. 
2. In the left sidebar, select **Add account**. 
3. Under **Account name**, enter the name for the account.
4. Under **Contact email**, enter the contact email to the owner of this service account.
5. Under **Access to data sets**, decide whether the account should have access to all data sets in the workspace ("Grant all workspace data") or just to selected data sets ("Select data sets manually").
6. Select the **Create service account** button. 

After that, your account will be created, and you will get the values for the service account secret, ID, and API key. You will need them to [authenticate API calls](authentication.md).

**Note that** you will see the service account secret only once. Copy it and store securely.
