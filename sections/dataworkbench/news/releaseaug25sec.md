# August 2025 release
Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the August 2025 second release. 

## Changes in existing features
This section covers changes in existing features.

### Data catalogue table improvements for created and predefined datasets
We have updated the table view in the **Data catalogue** for both created and predefined datasets:

- Adjusted the **Shared by** column for created datasets to improve visibility and consistency.
- Renamed **Created** column to **Last modified (UTC)** and removed seconds from the timestamp.
- Changed the column order for predefined datasets.
- Added a horizontal scroll bar if the table is too wide.

### Empty state for API management without service accounts
When you open the **API management** tab and your workspace has no service accounts, you will now see an empty state message and a button to **Add account**.

## Bug fixes

### Schema description formatting
We have fixed a text display issue on the **Data Integrations** page.  
In the FuelEU Period and FuelEU Period Consumption schemas, the description for the Reallocation Period Type column now displays each new line correctly.
