# August 2025 release
Read this page to learn what has changed in Veracity Data Workbench with the August 2025 third release. 

## Find your customer ID
In Data Workbench, the customer ID uniquely identifies your tenant and is the same across all workspaces in that tenant.

You can find the customer ID in several places:
- In the tenant picker, however over your workspace name.

- On the **Workspace** page, open the **Details** tab and check the number below **Customer ID**.
	- Alternatively, in the **Description** section, select the editing icon and read your **Customer ID** in the dialog that opens.
