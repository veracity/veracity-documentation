# Workspace
The workspace page has three tabs related to your Data Workbench workspace:
* Members: Workspace member management.
* Details: Workspace name, region, and description.
* Activity log: Logs of all activity in a workspace.

## Members and access levels
Under **Workspace members**, you can use the search bar to find a workspace member by their name or email.
For each member, you see the following data:
* Name
* Email
* Tenant access level
* Workspace access level

Access level are the member's permissions to access and modify data, and they can be defined on tenant and workspace level.

Regarding **Tenant access level**:
* A member can belong to a tenant containing this workspace and have a Tenant Admin or Tenant Reader role in this tenant.
* A Tenant Admin can fully manage the account (tenant) and all workspaces.
* A Tenant Reader can only view all workspaces and read data in them.
* By default, a member's tenant role gives them the same permissions in each workspace in this tenant.
* A Tenant Admin or Tenant Reader cannot be removed from a workspace in this tenant.
* You can upgrade a Tenant Reader's permission in a workspace to Workspace Admin.

Regarding **Workspace access level**:
* A Workspace Admin has full control over the workspace, including managing members (add, change role, remove) and all functions.
* A Workspace Reader has limited access to view content, share data, and download data within the workspace.

### To add workspace members
To add one or more members to the workspace:
1. In the top right corner, select **Invite workspace members**.
2. Enter the member's email address and select the member's role ("Reader" or "Admin").
If the member is not registered in Veracity, you will be prompted to invite them to Veracity.
3. Select the **Add** button. This will add the member to the workspace. You can add more than one member.
4. Select the **Invite** button. This will send the member a message informing them they were added to the workspace.

* Region: Where this workspace's data is stored (EU or USA). Note that after you select a Region, you cannot change it. Data residency regulations may require you to select a specific region.
* Description: Workspace description.
* Customer ID: Uniquely identifies your tenant and is the same across all workspaces in that tenant.
