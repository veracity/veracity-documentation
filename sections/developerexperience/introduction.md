# Project and resource overview

A project is used for organizing your resource groups. Usually, you use one project per product. You can add collaborators to a project and assign them access rights.

A resource group is a container used for organizing your resources. A resource group is labeled with the environment in which it is located ("devtest", "test", "staging", or "production").

A resource is any platform capability that needs to be provisioned for your project before you can use it. For example, application credentials.
