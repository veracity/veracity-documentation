# Product Delivery

## Automated Delivery
In todayâ€™s fast-paced market, automated delivery is a necessity. Developers should create robust systems that facilitate the instant provisioning of the product post-purchase, enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing time to value.<a href="https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/marketplace/sellingyourproduct/paidservices#delivering-the-purchased-service"> Read more</a>

## Paid Services
You can create digital services available for purchase. These services are instantly accessible to customers after they make a purchase. It is essential to set up pricing tiers, variants, and plans to cater to different needs and budgets. Consider using a side-by-side pricing plan if you have multiple variants or a one-column plan for simpler offerings.

## Lead Generating Services
Even if you are not ready to sell digitally, you can attract potential customers by offering a product page on Veracity marketplace with a lead-generating button (contact provider or get a price quote). We instrument these buttons to give you back insights, of how users engage with your product. Leads mean potential buyers and should be collected and handled with high importance in your sales funnel.

## Free Services
Sometimes, giving customers free access to your service can be a strategic move. It allows users to explore your product, experience its value, and potentially upgrade to paid plans later. Free services can serve as a powerful marketing tool, but remember not to give away valuable capabilities.

## Combinations
You can combine different options. For instance, they offer both free and paid versions of your service. This flexibility caters to a broader audience and accommodates varying preferences.

## Digital Quotes
Customize a specific quote to a specific customer based on marketplace product page offerings. This feature streamlines the negotiation process and ensures clarity in pricing. <a href="https://developer.veracity.com/docs/section/marketplace/sellingyourproduct/digitalquote">Read more</a>
