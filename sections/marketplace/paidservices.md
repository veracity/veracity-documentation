# Paid services

When planning to sell a service through Veracity Marketplace, you should have reached a high grade of maturity of your product and be ready for scalability. Get in touch with us if you want to know more about how "ready you are for selling digitally". Veracity supports processing charges in multiple currencies, including Euro (EUR), British pound sterling (GBP) and U.S. Dollars (USD).

The following section gives an overview of the different pricing models you can use for your product.

## Standard price plan - horizontal visualization​

Standard pricing plans, with a horizontal view of the different pricing, are used when the provider needs to sell different  “Product variants”. A product variant describes different software solutions or packages of online software/APIs, data sets.​
Every variant has a name (1) and a description (2).​
When naming a specific variant, please try to be short and to the point in what the user gets. The description below the name of the variant should help in specifying what it`s included in this package. ​The pricing models rows (3) should be kept simple, and differentiate mainly by:​
* Prices ​
* Type of customers (eg. One users, 2-6 users, students, enterprise)​
* Subscription type (one-time, recurrent, yearly, monthly, support duration, etc.)​

## Comparable price plan - vertical visualization​
Comparable price plans are used when you need a more detailed explanation for the customer on what features or usage that is included in each product variant/price tier.​
When choosing this configuration you shall choose:​
* A name that is short and self-explanatory (1)​
* Different prices and subscription type; (2)
* A brief explanation at the top (we recommend this to be short, as features area should already cover most of the added value for your product) (3)
* Features and usage (4)
​
Typical examples of product features can be:​
* Technical integrations available​
* Sharing features​
* Level of access, or rights (eg, Manager, viewer, etc.)​
* Usage or consumption (eg, Mb/Tb data storage, number APIs) ​
​
As a rule, when choosing this price plan, we suggest that you describe most of your product offerings in the descriptive paragraphs in the centre of the page. When you come to text in the pricing plan, you shall try to summarize and be specific to what the customer gets.

## Online contracting
In order to do online contacting the terms and conditions for your service needs to be displayed  so that the customer can click-accept. This agreement is then between you as the provider of the service and the customer. Veracity only supports B2B purchases so we are asking for the customers company information in the purchase process. The terms for your service will be displayed as below

## Payment options

After accepting the terms and conditions of the service the customer have to enter details about themselves and their company or if they are a Veracity user already, the known information will be prefilled.

In the image above the service provider have decided to offer both payment by credit card and by invoice. This is configurable, you can decide if you want to offer credit card payment and/or invoice payment. It can even be set up so that you only allow credit card for small amounts and offer both options for larger amounts.

 ## Order confirmation and invoice
 In addition to confirmation messages on screen the customer will get an order confirmation on mail. Later he will also get a formal invoice, when the purchase is paid by credit card the invoice will be marked as pre-paid

## Delivering the purchased service
Purchased products should be delivered over Veracity. This will ensure a consistent user experience and secure access to it by using the Veracity identity. Digital services/apps will be delivered over "My services", data sets on "My data". 

For digital services/apps there are several options for how access to the service can be given. 
- Veracity can give automatic access to single user licences
- Veracity can give access to multi-user licences where the customer can share licenses with other users through a separate module in Veracity. 
- Giving access automatically or manually can also be decided based on payment method and/or price.
- A manual process can be set up to give access

Giving access to the service itself is in many cases not sufficient as there are needs to set-up access levels inside the service as well. We do have some options for giving messages to initiate this process as well. 

## Customer journey

## Using trial periods on subscriptions
For subscription services it is possible to add a free trial to show your prospective customers the value of your service and help them make an informed decision. You can start your customer’s subscription with a free trial period of your choosing. In the example below, DATE for CMC have chosen a 3 month free trial for their customers. The pricing plan purchase buttons will consequently reflect the chosen period - the button will say <em>"Try free for (period time)"</em>. You can choose between the following trial periods:
* 7 days trial
* 14 days trial
* 1 month trial
* 3 months trial
* 6 months trial

When purchasing the customer puts in their payment information as normal, and after the trial period ends the customer is charged for the service. Get in touch with your onboarding manager to discuss the possibility of adding a free trial period to your service.
