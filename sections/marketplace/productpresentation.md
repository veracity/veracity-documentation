Familiarize yourself by looking at some product presentations at store.veracity.com

We do have a few general guidelines to some of the elements of the product
## Naming your product
When you write a text about your product you need to think about how you want the information about your service to be visible for search engines like Google.

In both the Name of the product and in content on the product page it`s important to:
- Write what the product is really about â€“ so that search engines recognize the correct words and people who are not in your specific industry or context understand if your service is relevant for them
- Do not use abbreviations for the name of the product, spell it out

## Introduction text on your product
Introduction text should be short and to the point.
Write what you sell first. Be short, long sentences can be cut (depending on screen size)
Read the text out loud and test with your colleagues. Do they understand what you sell?

## Product key benefits
A product page will show 3 product key benefits. You should use these to describe the value of your product
Be short and tell what is important first: 
- what is the value proposition of your product?
- why should the a customer buy from you and not from a competitor?

## Product description sections
We suggest to write from 3 to 5 paragraphs to describe what the service is.

- write what the user actually gets (be short and direct to the point)
- avoid long and too generic descriptions
- show concrete examples of the application/API/Data set

You can do this by text but also by using relevant images or even videos.
