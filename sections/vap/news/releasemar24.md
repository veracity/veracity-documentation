# VAP 4.13 release

Read this page to learn what has changed in the Veracity Adapter for Power BI. 

This release brings quality improvements by redesigning **Manage File** and **Manage User** modules in the Admin Panel. Note that there are no changes in functionalities.

### New filters and sorting columns
On the 'Users' page (previously 'Manage Users') and on the 'Resources' page (previously 'Manage File'), we have enabled new filtering options for you and made some columns sortable.

To hide filtering options, select the magnifying glass icon again.

If you can sort a column, it has two arrows next to its name. The arrow in the dark blue colour shows the current sorting direction. For example, if the bottom arrow is dark blue, the column is sorted in the descending order. 

**To change the column's sorting order**, select the column's name.
