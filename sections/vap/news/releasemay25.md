# VAP 4.23 release

Read this page to learn what has changed in the Veracity Adapter for Power BI.

## New features

### Default role for new users  
New users are now automatically assigned the **DataReader** role when added to the system.  
This default assignment follows the [information security principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege), ensuring users only have the access necessary to read data unless additional permissions are explicitly granted.

### Improved UI for SAS token auto-renewal  
The **SAS token auto-renewal** feature now includes an updated interface that offers improved visibility and control.  
With this change, users can more easily monitor the renewal status of their tokens and manually trigger renewal when necessary.  
These updates enhance transparency and align with best practices for secure data access in Data Workbench.

### Service account activity history  
In the **Data Workbench Service Account** list view (located under the Resources tab), users can now view the activity history for each account.  
This ensures consistent visibility into what actions each service account has performed and supports auditability across your VAP environment.
