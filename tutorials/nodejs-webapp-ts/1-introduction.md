# Tutorial: Building a Node.JS application with Veracity
Welcome to this tutorial on building Node powered web applications with Veraicty. In this tutorial you will learn how to:

- build basic web applications with Node and ExpressJs.
- use TypeScript to ensure type safety within your node application.
- authenticate users with Veracity.
- call Veracity APIs on behalf of that user.

The source for this tutorial is available on GitHub for download and review. If you have any questions feel free to open an issue there.

## Note on TypeScript
This tutorial uses TypeScript to write all code. TypeScript gives us type safety and aids in documenting our code. Allthough the syntax is slightly different from vanilla JavaScript you should still be able to follow the tutorial. Simply ignore the typing syntax.
